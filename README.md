# Omid's YTDownloader
Simple YouTube downloader that downloads MP4 or MP3.
Do not use this program to download stuff illegaly. This program is made purely for educational purposes. I do not condone piracy.

This is my first program. I am working through Python Crash Course, and wanted to make something practical.

There's some stuff that needs to be done regarding a proper saving method (right now it only saves in the root directory) and a proper temp file system.

The GUI version works, and the CLI version will at some point be finished.
